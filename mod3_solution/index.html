              <p>Moment of honesty <br>
                Someones gotta take the lead tonight<br>
                Who's it gonna be?<br>
                I'm gonna sit right here<br>
                And tell you all that comes to me<br>
                If you have something to say<br>
                You should say it right now (you ready?)<br>
                You give me a feeling that I never felt before<br>
                And I deserve it, I think I deserve it<br>
                It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore<br>
                And I can't take it<br>
                I was wondering maybe<br>
                Could I make you my baby?<br>
                If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy<br>
                If you ask me I'm ready<br>

                I know you said to me<br>
                "This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"<br>
                Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually<br>
                If we gonna do something 'bout it<br>
                We should do it right now<br>
                (We should do it right now)<br>

                If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy<br>

                If you ask me I'm ready<br>
                Why give up before we try?<br>
                Feel the lows before the highs<br>
                Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)<br>
                I can't say I came prepared<br>
                I'm suspended in the air<br>
                Won't you come be in the sky with me<br>
